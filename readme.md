<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US" lang="EN-US"> Contained within "Assets\Scenes\Final Testing\MAP A" is the scenes used for gathering testing data for my dissertation project. During gameplay in these scenes, the vision will be tracked and logged through the 3D heatmap which is visible while the game is playing through the editor window.

This Project was constructed over the course of my COMP320 and COMP360 Modules. I heavily modified my Theta* AI scripts from COMP250 to reduce scope to create the heatmap system for this project, doing this allowed me to not overscope the artefact and focus on performance and reliability.
If a file has not been updated since its original import into this project, it has not been modified or used in this dissertation.
